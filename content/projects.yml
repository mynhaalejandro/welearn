#     So, what to do when everyone seem to release iPad icons but fail to include some crisp small size icons? Pushing the pixels for yourself of course. So here’s my take on the smaller sizes of an Apple iPad icon, called iPixelPad.

#     In 2008 I used the camera obscura as it was used by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 to create an Aperture and iPhoto replacement icon.

#     Nicéphore Niépce made it first possible to preserve an image taken with a camera obscura in 1826 or 1827 by using a special mixture of bitumen on a glass or metal plate, naming it Heliography. This first preserved image 'View from the Window at Le Gras' is the one you can see in the iPhoto icon.
